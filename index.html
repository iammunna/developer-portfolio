            <h3>Mukhe Jol asha Beef nihari recipe</h3>
            <small>Author: <span class="author">MD MuNna SarKer</span></small>

            <p>Nihari or nahari recipe: Nahari is a breakfast stew in which beef or mutton shank containing all the good
                fat,
                marrow and bones is slow-cooked all night with spices. The result is a silky, flavourful, mild warming
                shorba
                (soup) with the rich rogan (rendered fat or oil) floating on the surface. It is ideally had with a thick
                bread
                such as naan, which soaks up the shorba.

                While nihari is time-consuming, if you look at the recipe, it is requires very little work. The hardest
                part
                is
                assembling the long list of spices. After that it is just a matter of setting the pot on the stove or
                oven
                and
                letting it cook until the meat is soft and falls off the bones.

                üôèüèæThe nihari spice mix was adapted from Delhi-UP-Karachi-Khaane's YouTube channel, run by Mahmood
                Babar
                Ahmed.
                His channel is a treasure trove of reliable recipes.

                üçΩIn Calcutta, nihari is almost exclusively sold in the winter, sometimes with dal puri. Nihari from
                Sufia,
                Beeru's, Nafeel, UP Bihar restaurant are among the ones that are popular..

                Nihari is a Mughlai dish that most likely originated in Delhi or Lucknow (some even say Hyderabad)
                towards
                the
                end of the Mughal rule. After Partition it has become very popular in Pakistan and Bangladesh where it
                is
                often
                sold as Delhi wali nihari.</p>

                Put ice cubes in a blender jar and add coffee, milk, honey, cream and about two tablespoons of ice
                cream. If you don‚Äôt have a blender just take a shaker and put milk, honey, coffee, cream and give it a
                nice stir and then shake it! If you like your cold coffee extra creamy, then add some fresh cream and
                shake it <br>
                Blend it in the mixer, take some ice cubes and then pour it into glasses. Put a scoop of vanilla ice
                cream and top it with some chocolate syrup, nuts and raisins. Relish this recipe with some savoury
                delight!
