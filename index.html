            <p>Nihari or nahari recipe: Nahari is a breakfast stew in which beef or mutton shank containing all the good
                fat,
                marrow and bones is slow-cooked all night with spices. The result is a silky, flavourful, mild warming
                shorba
                (soup) with the rich rogan (rendered fat or oil) floating on the surface. It is ideally had with a thick
                bread
                such as naan, which soaks up the shorba.

                While nihari is time-consuming, if you look at the recipe, it is requires very little work. The hardest
                part
                is
                assembling the long list of spices. After that it is just a matter of setting the pot on the stove or
                oven
                and
                letting it cook until the meat is soft and falls off the bones.</p>

                Put ice cubes in a blender jar and add coffee, milk, honey, cream and about two tablespoons of ice
                cream. If you don’t have a blender just take a shaker and put milk, honey, coffee, cream and give it a
                nice stir and then shake it! If you like your cold coffee extra creamy, then add some fresh cream and
                shake it <br>
                Blend it in the mixer, take some ice cubes and then pour it into glasses. Put a scoop of vanilla ice
                cream and top it with some chocolate syrup, nuts and raisins. Relish this recipe with some savoury
                delight!
