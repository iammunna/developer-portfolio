        <h3>Mukhe Jol asha Beef nihari recipe</h3>
        <p>Nihari or nahari recipe: Nahari is a breakfast stew in which beef or mutton shank containing all the good
            fat,
            marrow and bones is slow-cooked all night with spices. The result is a silky, flavourful, mild warming
            shorba
            (soup) with the rich rogan (rendered fat or oil) floating on the surface. It is ideally had with a thick
            bread
            such as naan, which soaks up the shorba.

            While nihari is time-consuming, if you look at the recipe, it is requires very little work. The hardest part
            is
            assembling the long list of spices. After that it is just a matter of setting the pot on the stove or oven
            and
            letting it cook until the meat is soft and falls off the bones.

            üôèüèæThe nihari spice mix was adapted from Delhi-UP-Karachi-Khaane's YouTube channel, run by Mahmood Babar
            Ahmed.
            His channel is a treasure trove of reliable recipes.

            üçΩIn Calcutta, nihari is almost exclusively sold in the winter, sometimes with dal puri. Nihari from Sufia,
            Beeru's, Nafeel, UP Bihar restaurant are among the ones that are popular..

            Nihari is a Mughlai dish that most likely originated in Delhi or Lucknow (some even say Hyderabad) towards
            the
            end of the Mughal rule. After Partition it has become very popular in Pakistan and Bangladesh where it is
            often
            sold as Delhi wali nihari.</p>
